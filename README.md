Take Note! This app is currently using the free version of Render. It may take around **1 minute to start up app completely**. In addition, the backend database is **deleted after 1 month** (last updated as of 12 Jan 2025), so things may not work as expected if the period is past.

To fully explore the [functionalities](https://github.com/wangyuanchi/shibespace/tree/main/client#shibespace-showcase), you need to **create an account**.
